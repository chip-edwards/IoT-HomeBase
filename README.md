# IoT HomeBase
This is a derivitative work where I have cloned the code from:
Source: https://github.com/electrocoder/iotdashboard.

I have begun refactoring the code to fit my purpose.

I anticipate it to change over time until my work can stand on it's own.
However, I do not think it would be possible for me to even start if it was not for the wonderful work done by Sahin MERSIN. 

I am renaming the Project as IoT HomeBase.
However I am leaving the original Readme docs in tack in case by some chance my efforts are noticed. That way there is a link back to the original author and you can compare the code and also have the Original authors contact info.

Sahin Mersin was kind enough to make his work Open Source and use the MIT License which is what is such a huge time saver for me and allows me the freedom to experiment.

My sincere thanks to Sahin for his contributions to Open Source which gives me this huge boost.

The Licensing will remain MIT.

Once the code is refactored I will update the Read Me but leave a reference to the original work.
